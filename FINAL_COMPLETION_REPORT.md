## 🏗️ SOLID ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION

### ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**
- `VideoUploadService` - Handles only video uploads
- `S3FileStorageService` - Manages only S3 operations
- `MockVideoMetadataExtractor` - Extracts only metadata
- `LaravelQueueService` - Manages only queue operations

### ✅ **Open/Closed Principle**
- Services extensible through interfaces
- New storage providers can be added without modifying existing code
- Metadata extractors can be swapped (Mock ↔ FFmpeg)

### ✅ **Liskov Substitution Principle**
- `MockVideoMetadataExtractor` and `FFmpegVideoMetadataExtractor` are interchangeable
- Any implementation of `FileStorageInterface` can replace S3 service

### ✅ **Interface Segregation Principle**
- `FileStorageInterface` - Only file operations
- `VideoMetadataExtractorInterface` - Only metadata extraction
- `QueueServiceInterface` - Only queue operations

### ✅ **Dependency Inversion Principle**
- High-level `VideoUploadService` depends on abstractions (interfaces)
- Concrete implementations injected via Laravel's service container
